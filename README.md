hungaromet-odp-client
=====================

CLI program and Rust library to download data from HungaroMet ODP, 
the Open Data Policy platform of the Hungarian Meteorological Service 
(https://odp.met.hu/).

This is an independent project without any affiliation to 
HungaroMet Nonprofit Zrt.

We would like to express our gratitude to our colleagues at HungaroMet for 
maintaining the ODP service, thus making this project possible.

__Important__: If you are using this software, make sure to observe the 
licensing conditions related to the data itself, which is different from our 
software license. Please read the relevant "Terms of Use" documentation of the 
ODP service, which can be found right at the ODP root directory.
